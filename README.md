## Usage

Some version of this is probably hosted at https://patw.herokuapp.com/

You may need to refresh it a couple times initially because freehostingproblems.jpg. Took 17527ms to start up the time before I wrote this.


## Things I could've done differently:

I still need to change to using PostgreSQL rather than SQLite

I could've made it look pretty, either by spending more time doing CSS (probably not) or (more likely) started with a html template on which somebody else spent more time doing CSS, so it would've started out pretty at least.

I could've used WTForms for easier and maybe better form validation in register.html, but this way meant I had to write some JavaScript.

## Criticisms:

Polarsteps doesn't recognise Kosovo as a country for some mind-numbingly stupid reason, so there's not gonna be any Kosovan colouring anytime soon and will instead be added to Serbia - unless I somehow force it or actually get around to implementing lat/long with my own (or just other) country definitions

My personal Polarsteps data is slightly inconsistent with the reality, but that's entirely user error.

This website ugly, purple? seriously?

There's nowhere near enough comments...

## TODO

Neuter Guest User

Chart colour schemes?

change history into manage account data

allow users to add/delete specific rows, or entire maps
add something explaining that this is based on steps not lat/longs

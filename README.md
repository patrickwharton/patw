Things I could've done differently:

I could've used WTForms for easier and maybe better form validation in register.html, but this way meant I had to write some (bad) JavaScript.


TODO

ADD MORE COMMENTS

Criticisms:

Polarsteps doesn't recognise Kosovo as a country for some stupid reason, so there's not gonna be any Kosovan colouring anytime soon and will instead be added to Serbia - unless I somehow force it or actually implement lat/long with my own country defs

This website ugly, purple? what the actual fuck were you thinking?

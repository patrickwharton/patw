# Usage

Some version of this is probably hosted at https://patw.herokuapp.com/

You may need to refresh it a couple times initially because freehostingproblems.jpg


## Things I could've done differently:

I could've made this an actual README for a start.

I could host it somewhere else other than localhost, because that might actually mean people could see it.

I could've used WTForms for easier and maybe better form validation in register.html, but this way meant I had to write some JavaScript.

## Criticisms:

Polarsteps doesn't recognise Kosovo as a country for some stupid reason, so there's not gonna be any Kosovan colouring anytime soon and will instead be added to Serbia - unless I somehow force it or actually get around to implementing lat/long with my own (or just other) country definitions

My personal Polarsteps data is slightly inconsistent with the reality, but that's entirely user error.

This website ugly, purple? what on earth were you thinking?

There's nowhere near enough comments...

## TODO

Guest User

location
session config

Chart colour schemes?

change history into manage account data

allow users to add/delete specific rows, or entire maps
add something explaining that this is based on steps not lat/longs

More charts -
continents

Hockey scores ticker? YEAH. with links, updates every 30 secs when theres a game on, live scores
maybe goal alerts?

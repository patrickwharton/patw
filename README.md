Things I could've done differently:

I could've used WTForms for easier and maybe better form validation in register.html, but this way meant I had to write some (bad) JavaScript.

Criticisms:

Polarsteps doesn't recognise Kosovo as a country for some stupid reason, so there's not gonna be any Kosovan colouring anytime soon and will instead be added to Serbia - unless I somehow force it or actually get around to implementing lat/long with my own (or just other) country definitions

This website ugly, purple? what the actual fuck were you thinking?

Chart colour schemes?

change history into manage account data

allow users to add/delete specific rows, or entire maps
add something explaining that this is based on steps not lat/longs

More charts -
continents

Hockey scores ticker? YEAH. with links, updates every 30 secs when theres a game on, live scores
maybe goal alerts?
